# Some-C-Plus-Plus
Often times, when applying to a programming position, I tend to mention that my first exposure to programming was in C++ back in 2012 at Community College. However, the potential employer really has no way to prove this, and I'm often left wondering if my word is enough for them to believe me, or at least, for them to get an idea of the degree of my involvement with the language at the time. The computer I used back then won't even turn on now, so I thought all my files from the two semesters of programming were lost. Tonight (11-20-17), however, it occurred to me to check the Dropbox account I used then, and LOW AND BEHOLD, EVERYTHING WAS THERE. C++, Python, and even a little bit of Java. 

This repository houses samples of some of the code I wrote when I first started to program. I decided to name it `Some C++` in honor to the language which introduced me to the world of programming. However, as suggested above, there is not only `C++` code.
